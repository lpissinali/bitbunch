                    p Bitbunch uses order book data of over 30 exchanges to detect arbitrage potentials. Once we found an opportunity, we check the available order book volumes to see how much we can trade. The higher the volumes are, the more can we trade and thus profit.

                    p To anticipate sudden price changes, our machine learning algorithms check momentum indicators continously. We ony perform trades at low volatility â€“ never if a coin is overbought or oversold.
